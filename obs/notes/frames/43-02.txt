===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Pentecost** - "Pentecost" means "fiftieth (day)." You could use the word "Pentecost" in your translation and let the text explain the meaning. Or you could use a term that means, "50th day."
  * **celebrated the wheat harvest** - The Jews would thank God for the wheat harvest by bringing offerings and celebrate by having special meals. Wheat is a grain crop; if you have no word that means "wheat," you can use a more general word for grain. This happened in May; other crops were harvested at other times of the year.
  * **This year** - That is, "In the year that Jesus died."
